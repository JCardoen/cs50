0.  
BMP: 1bit(2 colours), 4bit(16 colours), 8bit(256 colours), true-color: RGB values so 8bit/colours which means 24bit/pixel
GIF: 8bit(256 colours)
JPEG: 8bit(256 colours)
PNG: PNG-8(256 colours), PNG-24(16 million colours), PNG-32 (over 9000)
1.  Graphics Interchange Format, GIF
2.  The difference between the two is whether or not, in the compression of a file, all original data can be recovered when the file is decompressed.

    Lossless: every single bit of data that was originally in the file remains after the file is decompressed.
    Lossy: redundant information is deleted, this is useful because the 'loss' is not always visible with the naked eye. This makes it excellent compression for video formats and pictures.

3.  Only JPEG
4.  First, the system modifies the filename’s first character in the file’s directory entry to signal that the file has been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled.
    Second, the system moves all of the file’s FAT clusters to the hard drive’s list of free clusters.
    
5.  There are several methods for that but the most common one is just replacing the file by ASCII NUL's to overwrite existing data.

6.  A 'header's that makes you able to declare the specified widths , or sizes if you will, of certain integer types. 

7.  uint means unsigned and int means signed. So you can specify how much bits each integer type will take up in the memory.

8.  8bits  BYTE;
    32 bits DWORD;
    32bits  LONG;
    16bits WORD;
    
9.  4D42h = "BM"

10. bfSize: size of the file itself, thus the image
    biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure

11. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner (source: MSDN)

12. biBitCount

13. If you did not specify the outputfile's name as a command-line argument

14. You always copy 1 element here, 1 input to 1 output

15. 1 byte

16. It seeks the 9th element of a file and returns it. 

17. Current position of the file pointer.
